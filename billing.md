# AWS Billing and Cost Management

AWS Billing and Cost Management provides a suite of features to help you set up your billing, retrieve and pay invoices, and analyze, organize, plan, and optimize your costs.

To get started, set up your billing to match your requirements. For individuals or small organizations, AWS will automatically charge the credit card provided.

For larger organizations, you can use AWS Organizations to consolidate your charges across multiple AWS accounts. You can then configure invoicing, tax, purchase order, and payment methods to match your organizationâ€™s procurement processes.

You can allocate your costs to teams, applications, or environments by using cost categories or cost allocation tags, or using AWS Cost Explorer. You can also export data to your preferred data warehouse or business intelligence tool.
